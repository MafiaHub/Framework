///
/// Core renderer singleton for the library, coordinates all library functions.
/// 
/// The Renderer class is responsible for creating and painting \link View Views \endlink, managing
/// \link Session Sessions \endlink, as well as coordinating network requests, events, JavaScript
/// execution, and more.
/// 
/// ## Initializing the Renderer 
/// To initialize the library, you should set up the Platform singleton and call Renderer::Create.
/// 
/// @par Example initialization code
/// ```
///   // Get the Platform singleton (maintains global library state)
///   auto& platform = Platform::instance();
/// 
///   // Setup config
///   Config my_config;
///   platform.set_config(my_config);
/// 
///   // Create platform handlers (these are the minimum required)
///   // (This is pseudo-code, you will need to define your own)
///   MyFileSystem* file_system = new MyFileSystem();
///   MyFontLoader* font_loader = new MyFontLoader();
///   
///   // Setup platform handlers
///   platform.set_file_system(file_system);
///   platform.set_font_loader(font_loader);
/// 
///   // Create the Renderer
///   RefPtr<Renderer> renderer = Renderer::Create();
/// 
///   // Create Views here
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Updating Renderer Logic
/// 
/// You should call Renderer::Update() from your main update loop as often as possible to give the
/// library an opportunity to dispatch events and timers:
/// 
/// @par Example update code
/// ```
/// void mainLoop()
/// {
///   while(true)
///   {  
///     // Update program logic here
///     renderer.Update();
///   }
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Rendering Each Frame
/// 
/// When your program is ready to display a new frame (usually in synchrony with the monitor
/// refresh rate), you should call Renderer::Render() so the library can render all active
/// \link View Views \endlink as needed.
/// 
/// @par Example rendering code
/// ```
/// void displayFrame()
/// {
///     // Render all Views as needed
///     renderer.Render();
/// 
///     // Each View will render to a
///     //   - Pixel-Buffer Surface (View::surface())
///     //     or
///     //   - GPU texture (View::render_target())
///     // based on whether CPU or GPU rendering is used.
///     //
///     // You will need to display the image data here as needed.
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// @note The App class creates and manages its own Renderer (optional API in AppCore, available on
///       desktop OS only).
/// 
/// @warning You should only create one Renderer during the lifetime of your program.
///
