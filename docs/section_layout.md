### Since /SECTIONLAYOUT is a very non-documented flag, here are some tips

The /SECTIONLAYOUT linker option is a Microsoft Visual Studio linker option that specifies how sections in the output file should be laid out in memory. This option is used to specify the order in which sections should be placed in the output file, as well as whether sections should be placed together or separately.

The /SECTIONLAYOUT option is typically used when creating DLLs or executables that need to be loaded by the Windows loader at a specific memory address. By specifying the /SECTIONLAYOUT option, you can control the order in which sections are placed in the output file, which can help ensure that the DLL or executable is loaded at the desired address.

The /SECTIONLAYOUT option is specified as a comma-separated list of section names and placement options. For example, the following /SECTIONLAYOUT option specifies that the .text and .data sections should be placed together in the output file, followed by the .rsrc section:

```
/SECTIONLAYOUT:.text,.data,ALIGN=1,.rsrc
```
In this example, the ALIGN=1 option specifies that the .text and .data sections should be placed together, with no padding between them. The .rsrc section is then placed after the .text and .data sections, with no padding between them.

The /SECTIONLAYOUT option can be used to specify a variety of different placement options for sections in the output file. For example, you can use the ALIGN option to specify the alignment of a section in the output file, the FILE option to specify the file that a section should be placed in, and the DISCARDABLE option to mark a section as discardable.

Overall, the /SECTIONLAYOUT linker option is a useful tool for controlling the layout of sections in the output file, which can be useful when creating DLLs or executables that need to be loaded at a specific memory address.

Additionally, section layout can also be specified by a file by using the `/SECTIONLAYOUT:@<FILE_PATH>` switch, where `<FILE_PATH>` is the path to the file containing the section layout information. The file should contain a list of section names and placement options, one per line. For example, the following file specifies that the .text and .data sections should be placed together in the output file, followed by the .rsrc section:

```
.text
.data
ALIGN=1
.rsrc
```
